# CS439-Semester-Project
This project uses the Pandas library for python to expore the data that has been collected regarding COVID-19 cases and deaths. We explore trends in the data and implement machine learning techniques in order to predict case death rate, as well as to identify factors that are affecting high case counts in certain areas.
